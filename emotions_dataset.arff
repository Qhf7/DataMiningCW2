17cs3k1,"Feeling Lonely Even When Not Alone","I have people close to me willing to help, but I feel as if there's a barrier between me and them. I have a hard time speaking my true thoughts, thanks to past experiences, and I feel like they don't understand me even when I do.

I feel so alone, and I feel as if I can't rely on anyone for support. This is not because they're not trying, but because I'm just not meeting where they want to... or the other way around.

I honestly don't know if I'm making sense but I've been in one of my lowest points for a while, and I can't help but keep crying every few minutes. I just want someone to talk to without giving me advice or telling me it will be ok.

It's not ok. I don't know if it will ever be ok. I don't even see myself surviving this weekend. But having someone I could talk to and listen to me just plain out would be amazing.

I don't know. Maybe I'm asking too much of people. I just hope I can lick my wounds enough that I have enough energy to fake it again next week.","Feeling Lonely Even When Not Alone ### I have people close to me willing to help, but I feel as if there's a barrier between me and them.

*Now, that my survival is my own responsibility, how am I to use the* ***LITTLE*** *energy that I have, to survive, let alone help my condition?* 

(I hope you guys understand: depression → loss of interest in everything → lack of motivation → little to no energy → almost burnt-out state)

Now, I am to channel my insignificant energy towards earning my livelihood, fuck livelihood, even earning basic needs such as food would be an overstatement. Even then let's consider the best-case scenario, that I barely manage to do so. If that were the case, I would be forever stuck in the endless loop of using all my energy to survive.

Sometimes when I start trying to better myself, I start feeling internally uncomfortable until I just fall back off the wagon and make no progress.

Im still looking for an in person therapist and affordable mental health support only recently became an option for me with the job I landed.

Why do I hate helping or bettering myself and feel a lot more comfortable being stuck exactly where I am?","Why am I so against helping myself? ### I feel like theres like a voice inside that dislikes when I try to help myself, or do the things I need to do. I know depression plays a major part in my lack of motivation and effort but how do I overcome this? How do I silence the voice inside that doesnt want me to be my best? That makes it hard to get out of bed or go to the gym and so on.

rio7t5,"Not a good day","My partner is spiraling - I can’t help her. She hates herself so much - she then turns her self hatred on me and my children. None of us can do anything right. Everything causes rage. Today should have been a happy day. It isn’t. I can’t leave her ever. She would die. Her family is part of the problem. I have no one to talk to. My kids want their mom back. I want my wife back. Her anger makes me a worse father. I lose my patience with my children because I use all my patience on her. I don’t want to do this anymore. I have to be here for my kids. My kids deserve better. Today isn’t a good day.","Not a good day ### My partner is spiraling - I can’t help her. She hates herself so much - she then turns her self hatred on me and my children.

14bhax7,"The longer I’m divorced the more I dislike my ex husband","I feel like I deluded myself throughout our 15 year marriage because I needed to believe he was a good person.

Since we separated 2 years ago I’ve realized what a terrible person he is. He tried to take $150k of my parents money, won’t look at me or speak to me when I have to pick up or drop off our child in person, complains to her about me, threatened to call the cops when I went back to our marital home to help declutter so we could sell it, and generally just believes that his wants and needs are more important than anyone else’s.

He really sucks. I’m so glad we’re divorced but I’m not looking forward to coparenting together for the rest of our lives. Ugh.","The longer I’m divorced the more I dislike my ex husband ### I feel like I deluded myself throughout our 15 year marriage because I needed to believe he was a good person.
